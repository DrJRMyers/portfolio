# Portfolio

With almost 20 years of professional writing and editing experience, I have seen and done a lot. I also have 9+ years’ experience in the B2B tech and SaaS sectors, specializing in content strategy, brand voice, and leveraging digital technologies to boost engagement and conversions.

In my career I thrived in startups, leading content teams and collaborating cross-functionally to drive impactful marketing initiatives. I'm particularly skilled in writing, messaging, content production, budget management, and data-driven decision-making. I also have a PhD (history) so I bring the [perspective and analytical skills](https://builtin.com/articles/why-tech-companies-should-consider-hiring-humanities-phds) from that training to the table. (See also [this](https://www.fastcompany.com/40440952/why-this-tech-ceo-keeps-hiring-humanities-majors), and [this](https://businessingmag.com/6578/leading/why-every-startup-should-consider-hiring-humanities-graduates/).)

I’m a professional learner and have a proven record for getting up to speed with new industries and technologies quickly. So, although I’m not a coder, I'm very tech savvy. __*I’m typically the person who everyone comes to when they need something done well and quickly.*__

Whether you're looking for a content writer (assets that inform) a copywriter (assets that convert), or an eagle-eyed editor, I've got your bases covered.

- We made seven 'seasons' of Meet The Developer, totaling over 50 videos. I served as producer, co-presenter, and script writer. Each shoot involved preproduction with SMEs and an external vendor, travel to California for in-studio shoots, and all-day prep sessions with SMEs/on-screen talent.

- I produced 14 high-quality animated videos on technical concepts around InfluxDB and time series data. Worked with multiple external vendors to produce visuals, sound design, voice over, and more. I served as producer, script writer.

##### Video Events

- InfluxData hosted an annual user event called InfluxDays for several years. In Fall 2022, we did an all online event with high production video content. This included more than 30 videos.

This event brought team members to California from all over the world for filming.

#### Training

### Plum Voice

An interactive voice response (IVR) company. Primarily marketing to developers and non-technical decision-makers, using a sales led growth approach.

I wore many different hats at Plum, starting off as a copywriter responsible for website and ad copy, B2B marketing materials, white papers, case studies, and blog posts all through January 2020. Along the way, I also inherited analyst relations where I presented product updates to analysts at firms like Gartner and Forrester. Later I transitioned to a technical writer role, responsible for product documentation. **NOTE:** SharpenCX acquired Plum Voice in late 2023/early 2024, which may affect historical content.
